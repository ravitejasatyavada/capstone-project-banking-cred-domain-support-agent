# Final Capstone — Cred Domain Support Agent (CrewAI)

**Track: Banking & FinTech (Cred).** **Estimated duration: 14 days.**

Real production support agents combine several building blocks into one working
system: dataset design, embeddings, vector retrieval, grounded generation, agent
memory, tool-calling agents, multi-agent orchestration, structured outputs,
guardrails, evaluation, AI governance, cost control, and API deployment. This
capstone asks you to bring all of it together into ONE working, production-minded
agent: a domain support agent that answers policy questions from a knowledge base
you write, looks up real records from a dataset you design and validate yourself,
remembers a conversation, is guarded against misuse, has its own answers reviewed by
a second independent agent team before they reach the user, and operates under an
explicit governance policy — orchestrated with CrewAI, deployed behind a FastAPI
backend, and evaluated end to end.

Cred's lending-operations team wants an agent that answers loan-policy questions and
checks a specific loan application's status, so support staff can respond to member
queries instantly and consistently. You are building that agent — and building it to
a standard where it could pass a real production governance review, not just a
happy-path demo.

**Total marks:** 100 · **One deliverable:** a single public GitHub repository
containing your dataset, RAG core, CrewAI agent crew, Autogen review stage, and
FastAPI deployment.

## Submission Guidelines (read first)

- Submit **one public GitHub repository link** for the whole project. There is no
  per-Part submission — one repo contains everything.
- State at the top of your `README.md` that you completed the **Cred (Banking &
  FinTech)** track, and include the exact dataset-design choices you made in Part 1
  Task 1 (seed, category/status weights, amount range) so the grader can reproduce
  your dataset deterministically.
- No images, screenshots, diagrams-to-upload, PDFs, slide decks, presentations, video,
  or audio are required or accepted anywhere in this project. Every deliverable is code
  or text inside the repository.
- Nothing in this project requires a paid account or a credit card. Embeddings
  (SentenceTransformers) and the vector index (ChromaDB) are free and run locally. The
  agent's language-model calls (grounded generation, the judge used for evaluation,
  the CrewAI crew, and the Autogen review team) default to a deterministic `MOCK_LLM`
  mode that needs zero API keys and zero network access — this is the mode your
  graded transcripts must use. A real LLM API may optionally be wired in behind an
  environment-variable flag, but every acceptance criterion below must be
  demonstrably satisfied under `MOCK_LLM` alone.
- **Implementing `MOCK_LLM` for a CrewAI crew is more involved than a simple flag** —
  extend `crewai.llms.base_llm.BaseLLM` (CrewAI's own documented extension point for a
  non-`litellm` LLM) rather than trying to intercept calls externally. Two known
  pitfalls, both silent (no crash, just wrong output) if you miss them: (1) CrewAI's
  own built-in ReAct system-prompt template literally contains the example text
  `"Observation: the result of the action"` — a parser that searches the conversation
  for the string `"Observation:"` to extract a tool's result will match this template
  text on the very first call, before any tool has run, and silently return
  placeholder text as the final answer; parse the model's own generated text, not the
  system-prompt template. (2) Do not dispatch a tool call's arguments by matching the
  tool's *name* (e.g. checking whether `"lookup"` is a substring of the tool name) — a
  tool literally named `rag_lookup` will be silently misclassified; dispatch off the
  tool's own declared argument schema instead.
- **CrewAI's own telemetry attempts an outbound network call by default** when
  `crew.kickoff()` runs, which would silently violate the zero-network-access
  requirement above. Set `CREWAI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true` (or `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true`)
  as an environment variable before running your crew, and confirm in your
  `README.md` that you set it.
- You may refer to official documentation (e.g. the CrewAI docs, the Autogen docs, the
  LangChain docs at python.langchain.com, the ChromaDB docs, the FastAPI docs, the
  Python standard library docs) while writing your code. AI assistants and
  code-generation tools remain prohibited.
- Originality: your dataset, knowledge base, code, and analysis must be your own work
  for this specific brief.
- Submit your one repository link by the end of the 14-day capstone window.

## Your scenario

**Given category vocabulary (use every value at least once; you may add more):**
`Personal Loan`, `Home Loan`, `Auto Loan`, `Education Loan`, `Business Loan`.

**Given status vocabulary (use every value at least once; you may add more):**
`Submitted`, `Under Review`, `Approved`, `Rejected`, `Disbursed`.

**Required knowledge-base topics (≥12 documents, ≥2-5 sentences each):** loan
eligibility criteria by loan type, EMI calculation rules, credit-card fee structure,
KYC document requirements, fraud-dispute resolution process, account-closure process,
interest-rate slabs, prepayment-penalty rules, minimum-balance requirements,
credit-score impact factors, joint-account rules, and NRI-account eligibility.

**Guardrail-relevant PII fields:** PAN/Aadhaar number and bank account number are
fixed-format and must be demonstrated masked by your input-side guardrail (Task 10).
Applicant name and income figures are free text/unformatted numbers with no reliable
pattern to match under a keyless, `MOCK_LLM`-only masker — acknowledged as out of
scope for masking; use only fabricated examples for both, never anyone's real data.

## Part 1 — Dataset Design & RAG Core (30 marks)

**Tasks**

1. **Design and validate your own loan-application dataset.** Write a seeded,
   deterministic Python generator (`dataset.py`) producing a `LOAN_APPLICATIONS` list
   of ≥40 records. Use every category and status value given above at least once (you
   may add more values). Each record needs: `record_id`, `category`, `status`,
   `loan_amount_inr` (choose a realistic range and state your reasoning in one
   sentence), `days_since_created` (integer, 0–30), and `flagged_for_fraud_review`
   (boolean). Print and report: the count per category (every given category ≥3
   records), the count per status (every given status ≥1 record), and the percentage
   of records with `flagged_for_fraud_review=True` (must land between 10% and 30% —
   if your first random draw doesn't land there, change your seed or weights and
   regenerate; never hand-edit individual records to force the number).
2. **Write your knowledge base.** Author the ≥12 required documents above (2–5
   sentences each, in your own words, covering every required topic).
3. **Implement and index two chunking strategies.** Chunk your documents BOTH as
   fixed-size-with-overlap AND as sentence-based chunks. Embed every chunk in both
   sets with a free local SentenceTransformers model, and index each chunking
   strategy in its OWN separate ChromaDB collection (`collection.upsert()`).
4. **Implement grounded generation.** Given a query, retrieve the top-k chunks (from
   either collection) and generate an answer using ONLY the retrieved context. Under
   `MOCK_LLM` there is no real model to judge groundedness, so retrieval similarity is
   your only signal — **calibrate your "I don't know" threshold empirically before
   picking one**: measure your own top-1 cosine similarity for at least 3 in-scope
   queries and at least 2 deliberately out-of-scope queries, then set the threshold
   between the two clusters you actually observe. Do not use an untested preset
   (0.5/0.6/0.7 are common tutorial defaults that do not reliably separate short
   policy-sentence embeddings from unrelated queries) — state your measured values and
   chosen threshold in `README.md`. Demonstrate on ≥5 real in-scope queries plus 1
   deliberately out-of-scope query that must trigger the fallback.
5. **Evaluate and compare both chunking strategies.** For the same ≥5 queries from
   Task 4, compute precision and recall at the document level (map chunks back to
   parent documents and dedup before scoring) **separately for each of your two
   collections**, showing per-query arithmetic for both. Write 2–3 sentences
   recommending which strategy you would deploy, citing your own two sets of numbers.

## Part 2 — CrewAI Multi-Agent Orchestration with Tools, Memory & Guardrails (30 marks)

Using Part 1's RAG core (your recommended chunking strategy's collection) as a fixed
input, build the orchestration layer.

**Tasks**

6. **Build the second tool with a designed escalation score.** Using `dataset.py`
   from Task 1, implement `check_loan_application_status(record_id: str) -> dict`
   returning the application's `status`, `loan_amount_inr`, and a **designed**
   `escalation_score` in `[0, 1]` that combines `flagged_for_fraud_review` with a
   normalized recency signal derived from `days_since_created`. State your exact
   formula and the threshold above which you recommend escalation, justified using
   your own dataset's distribution (e.g. "this threshold corresponds to the 80th
   percentile of `days_since_created` in my generated data").
7. **Build a CrewAI crew.** Construct a crew with ≥3 agents — at minimum a Retrieval
   Agent equipped with your RAG tool (Task 3–5), a Lookup Agent equipped with your
   `check_loan_application_status` tool (Task 6), and a Response Composer agent that
   combines their outputs into one final draft answer — and run it via `.kickoff()`.
   Demonstrate both the RAG tool and the lookup tool actually being invoked on
   different sample queries.
8. **Add session memory.** Using LangChain's session-based memory (e.g.
   `InMemoryChatMessageHistory` + `RunnableWithMessageHistory` — note:
   `RunnableWithMessageHistory` raises a `LangChainDeprecationWarning` pointing to
   LangGraph's own persistence layer; this is expected and does not need to be
   silenced, the class still functions correctly here), maintain conversation history
   across turns within one process run and demonstrate state correctly carried across
   a multi-turn exchange in one transcript, with a **separate** fresh-conversation
   transcript showing that state correctly absent/reset. This memory is in-process
   only (it does not need to survive a restart) — that is sufficient for this task.
9. **Add a structured output schema.** Define a Pydantic `BaseModel` that every crew
   response must conform to (`response_format`), and validate each response against it
   in code.
10. **Add guardrails.** Implement input-side guardrails — PII masking, demonstrated
    firing on the fixed-format PII field(s) identified above, and prompt-injection
    detection — and an output-side groundedness check that refuses to answer when the
    retrieved context doesn't support the question. Demonstrate each guardrail
    actually firing on one
    deliberate test case.

## Part 3 — Evaluation, Observability & FastAPI Deployment (20 marks)

Using Part 2's crew as a fixed input, wrap and evaluate it.

**Tasks**

11. **Deploy via FastAPI.** Expose your crew behind at least 2 HTTP endpoints (e.g.
    `POST /ask`, `POST /add-document`) using Pydantic request/response models, **plus**
    one WebSocket endpoint (`@app.websocket`) for real-time multi-turn chat that
    gracefully handles a client disconnecting mid-conversation (catch
    `WebSocketDisconnect`, keep the server running for other clients).
12. **Add structured logging.** Log every request as one JSON-Lines entry with a trace
    ID and timing information (ELK-style structured logging). The logged request text
    must NOT contain the raw, unmasked value of any fixed-format PII field your
    Task 10 guardrail masks — apply the same masking to what you log as you apply to
    what the model sees, so a fixed-format PII field never reaches disk in the clear.
13. **Evaluate with Accuracy, Grounding, Completeness, and Safety at scale.** Using an
    LLM-as-judge prompt (running under `MOCK_LLM`), build a test set of **15
    queries** — at least 1 touching every required KB topic from your scenario, plus
    at least 2 deliberately out-of-scope or edge-case queries — and score all four
    properties for every query, reporting all four scores per query **and** the
    average of each score across all 15.

## Part 4 — Resilience & Governance (20 marks)

Using Part 2's crew as a fixed input, harden and govern it.

**Tasks**

14. **Add an Autogen review stage after your crew's draft answer.** Build a 2-agent
    Autogen Round Robin Group Chat team (e.g. a Policy-Compliance-Reviewer agent and
    a Final-Editor agent) via `RoundRobinGroupChat`, bounded with `max_turns=2` (the
    real constructor parameter is `max_turns`, not `max_iterations`) — or, if you use
    `MaxMessageTermination` instead, remember it counts the initiating task message
    as message 1, so `MaxMessageTermination(3)` (not `(2)`) is what actually lets
    both agents speak. Give the Final-Editor a Pydantic structured output via
    `output_content_type=<YourVerdictModel>` on the agent — this requires the Team
    itself to also be constructed with
    `custom_message_types=[StructuredMessage[YourVerdictModel]]`, or the run crashes
    with `ValueError: Message type ... is not registered`. The team takes your
    CrewAI Composer's draft answer plus the original retrieved context as input, and
    either approves it unchanged or revises it; the verdict model should have fields
    `approved: bool`, `final_answer: str`, `reason: str`. Demonstrate on ≥2 sample
    queries: at least one case where the review stage approves the draft unchanged,
    and at least one case where it actually revises the draft (e.g. catches an
    ungrounded claim you deliberately injected into the draft for the test).
15. **Apply the four-layer AI-governance model.** At the **Application layer**,
    enforce the principle of least autonomy: only your Lookup Agent may call
    `check_loan_application_status` — no other agent in your crew may call it
    directly, and you must demonstrate this restriction (e.g. show that wiring the
    tool to another agent is blocked or simply never wired, with a one-paragraph
    explanation of the guard). Classify your own system's risk level using the
    Low/Medium/High risk scheme (Low: summarization/transcription; Medium: code
    generation/customer support tickets; High: medical data, hiring decisions,
    financial data), with a one-paragraph justification.
    At the **Runtime layer**, enforce a per-request token/cost budget cap and
    demonstrate a deliberately oversized request being rejected rather than silently
    exceeding the budget.
16. **Add response caching.** Implement an in-memory cache keyed by normalized query
    text for your grounded-generation step. Demonstrate a repeated identical query
    producing a cache hit that avoids a redundant LLM/tool call, with before/after
    evidence (a call counter or timing comparison).

## Acceptance criteria (your submission is complete when…)

**Part 1**
- `dataset.py` generates ≥40 loan applications meeting every stated structural
  threshold (category counts, status coverage, `flagged_for_fraud_review` percentage
  band), with your design choices stated in `README.md`.
- Your knowledge base has ≥12 documents covering every required topic.
- Both chunking strategies are implemented, embedded, and indexed into two separate
  ChromaDB collections that both produce sensible retrieval on a sample query.
- Grounded generation is demonstrated on ≥5 in-scope queries plus 1 out-of-scope query
  that correctly triggers the "I don't know" fallback.
- Precision/recall are computed for BOTH collections on the same ≥5 queries with
  visible per-query arithmetic, and a numbers-cited recommendation is given.

**Part 2**
- `check_loan_application_status` correctly looks up a record and correctly computes a
  designed, justified `escalation_score` (not a bare boolean OR).
- The CrewAI crew has ≥3 agents (Retrieval, Lookup, Composer at minimum); both the RAG
  tool and the `check_loan_application_status` tool are demonstrably invoked on
  different queries via `.kickoff()`.
- Multi-turn memory is demonstrated, with a separate fresh-conversation transcript
  showing it correctly absent.
- Every crew response validates against a declared Pydantic structured-output schema.
- Both guardrails (input-side PII/injection, output-side groundedness) are demonstrated
  actually firing on a deliberate test case each.

**Part 3**
- The FastAPI backend exposes ≥2 working HTTP endpoints plus 1 working WebSocket
  endpoint that survives a client disconnect without crashing, all with correct
  Pydantic models where applicable.
- Every request produces one structured JSON-Lines log entry with a trace ID.
- All four evaluation scores (Accuracy, Grounding, Completeness, Safety) are reported
  per-query for all 15 test queries under `MOCK_LLM`, plus the four averages.

**Part 4**
- The Autogen review stage is demonstrated both approving a draft unchanged and
  revising a draft, with structured Pydantic verdicts in both cases.
- Least-autonomy enforcement is demonstrated (only the Lookup Agent can call the
  lookup tool); a risk classification with justification is given; a runtime
  cost-budget cap correctly rejects an oversized simulated request.
- Response caching is demonstrated producing a real cache hit with before/after
  evidence on a repeated query.

## Submission

Submit **one public GitHub repository link**. The repository must contain, in total:
`dataset.py`, your knowledge-base documents, your RAG/crew/review-stage/governance/
deployment code with transcripts demonstrating every task above, and a `README.md`
confirming everything runs under `MOCK_LLM` with zero API keys. There is exactly one
submission link for the whole project.
